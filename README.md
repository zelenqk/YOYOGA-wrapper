# YOYOGA-wrapper

> A wrapper for exploring GameMaker’s new FlexPanel (Yoga-based) UI system.

## About This Wrapper

This is an attempt to demystify the new UI system in GameMaker — specifically the FlexPanel/Yoga-based layout tools.

While this wrapper isn't production-ready, it's a great starting point to understand how the system works.  
You can study it, extend it, or build your own version from scratch.

- Check the [REFERENCE](https://github.com/zelenqk/YOYOGA-wrapper/blob/main/notes/REFFERENCE/REFFERENCE.txt) note for a full list of element style properties.
- The oController object is used as an example of how to add instances to UI layers at runtime.

## Prerequisites

> Important: GameMaker requires some setup in the IDE for this to work correctly.

-	You must create a UI layer manually using the IDE.**  
	GameMaker does not support creating UI layers at runtime (or at least, I couldn’t get it to work maybe I did it wrong, who knows).

-	Do not attach a FlexPanel to the UI layer in the IDE.
	Let the wrapper handle this during runtime. Otherwise, layout issues will occur.

## What's Next?

I might rebuild this into something more powerful later.  
For now, feel free to poke around and modify it to fit your needs.
